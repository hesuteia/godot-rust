<!-- 
Bug reports document cases where the library does not behave as intended or documented.
If you are unsure about how to use the library, open a 'Question' issue or ask on Discord: https://discord.gg/FNudpBD
For missing functionality, open a 'Feature request' instead.
For functionality that works but is not very accessible, open a 'Quality of life' issue instead.

In your bug report, please mention how to reproduce the problem and if possible, provide short example code.
In case you're not working on latest master, specify which godot-rust version you use.
