<!-- 
Quality-of-life issues improve existing aspects of the library: API ergonomics, documentation, refactoring.
For new functionality, open a 'Feature request' instead.
For functionality which is broken rather than provided in a suboptimal way, open a 'Bug report'.

In your request, please mention the motivation for the change,
as well as potential drawbacks and alternatives.
