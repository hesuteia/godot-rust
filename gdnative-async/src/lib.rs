//! Runtime async support for godot-rust.
//!
//! This crate contains types and functions that enable using async code with godot-rust.
//!
//! # Safety assumptions
//!
//! This crate assumes that all user non-Rust code follow the official threading guidelines.

// Workaround for macros that expect the `gdnative` crate.
