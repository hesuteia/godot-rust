/// Trait for declaring library-level GDNative callbacks. See module-level docs for examples.
///
/// Each end-user library must contain one and exactly one implementation of this trait.
/// It must be annotated with the [`#[gdnative::init::callbacks]`][callbacks]
/// proc-macro attribute.
///
/// The most commonly useful callback to implement is [`Self::nativescript_init`], which allows
/// the implementor to manually register [`NativeClass`][crate::export::NativeClass] types so
/// they can be used from Godot.
///
/// An alternative to manual registration is the `inventory` feature, which automatically
/// registers derived [`NativeClass`][crate::export::NativeClass] on
/// [supported platforms][inventory-support], which at the time of writing includes every platform
/// that Godot officially supports except WASM.
///
/// For all callbacks in this trait, it's guaranteed that the Godot API is available when called.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// With manual registration:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use gdnative::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(NativeClass)]
/// # #[no_constructor]
/// struct HelloWorld { /* ... */ }
///
/// #[methods]
/// impl HelloWorld { /* ... */ }
///
/// struct MyLibrary;
///
/// #[gdnative::init::callbacks]
/// impl GDNativeCallbacks for MyLibrary {
///     fn nativescript_init(handle: InitHandle) {
///         handle.add_class::<HelloWorld>();
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// With automatic registration:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use gdnative::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(NativeClass)]
/// # #[no_constructor]
/// struct HelloWorld { /* ... */ }
///
/// #[methods]
/// impl HelloWorld { /* ... */ }
///
/// struct MyLibrary;
///
/// #[gdnative::init::callbacks]
/// impl GDNativeCallbacks for MyLibrary {}
/// ```
///

    /// to do with exposing "singleton" objects or static-looking methods to GDScript. Instead,
    /// create a [`NativeClass`][crate::export::NativeClass] inheriting `Node` and make that an
    /// auto-load in your project settings. See [the FAQ][auto-load-faq] for an example.
    ///
    /// Despite the confusing name, what the `singleton` option does is to mark the GDNative
    /// library for automatic initialization at the startup of the application before any game
    /// content and scripts are loaded, which might be useful in some use cases. The extra
    /// callback itself doesn't have any special qualities.
    ///

    ///
    /// - [`Self::gdnative_init`] has been invoked exactly once, immediately before.
