/// `ThreadLocal` references to manually-managed types cannot normally be obtained, since

/// freed on drop, and are *leaked* if not passed to the engine or freed manually with `free`.
/// `Unique` references can be obtained through constructors safely, or `assume_unique` in
/// unsafe contexts.
///
/// # Reference-counted types
///
/// `Shared` references to reference-counted types, like `Ref<Reference, Shared>`, act like
/// `Arc` smart pointers. New references can be created with `Clone`, and they can be sent
/// between threads. The pointer is presumed to be always valid. As such, more operations
/// are available even when thread safety is not assumed. However, API methods still can't be
/// used directly, and users are required to obtain a safe view first. See the "Obtaining a
/// safe view" section below for more information.
///
/// `ThreadLocal` reference to reference-counted types, like `Ref<Reference, ThreadLocal>`, add
/// the ability to call API methods safely. Unlike `Unique` references, it's unsafe to convert
/// them to `Shared` because there might be other `ThreadLocal` references in existence.
///
/// # Obtaining a safe view
///
/// In a lot of cases, references obtained from the engine as return values or arguments aren't
/// safe to use, due to lack of pointer validity and thread safety guarantees in the API. As
/// such, it's usually required to use `unsafe` code to obtain safe views of the same object
/// before API methods can be called. The ways to cast between different reference types are as
/// follows:
///
/// | From | To | Method | Note |
/// | - | - | - | - |
/// | `Unique` | `&'a T` | `Deref` (API methods can be called directly) / `as_ref` | - |
/// | `ThreadLocal` | `&'a T` | `Deref` (API methods can be called directly) / `as_ref` | Only if `T` is a reference-counted type. |
/// | `Shared` | `&'a T` | `unsafe assume_safe::<'a>` | The underlying object must be valid, and exclusive to this thread during `'a`. |
/// | `Unique` | `ThreadLocal` | `into_thread_local` | - |
/// | `Unique` | `Shared` | `into_shared` | - |
/// | `Shared` | `ThreadLocal` | `unsafe assume_thread_local` | The reference must be local to the current thread. |
/// | `Shared` / `ThreadLocal` | `Unique` | `unsafe assume_unique` | The reference must be unique. |
/// | `ThreadLocal` | `Shared` | `unsafe assume_unique().into_shared()` | The reference must be unique. |
///
/// # Using as method arguments or return values
///
/// In order to enforce thread safety statically, the ability to be passed to the engine is only
/// given to some reference types. Specifically, they are:
///
/// - All *owned* `Ref<T, Unique>` references. The `Unique` access is lost if passed into a
///   method.
/// - Owned and borrowed `Shared` references, including temporary ones (`TRef`).
///
/// It's unsound to pass `ThreadLocal` references to the engine because there is no guarantee
/// that the reference will stay on the same thread.
///

/// When viewing rustdoc documentation, you may expand the documentation on their respective
