/// about exported properties.

/// `NativeClass` macro for detailed usage and examples.

    /// In Godot, scripting languages can define "script instances" which can be
    /// attached to objects. Because of the dynamic nature, the intended "inheritance"
    /// is not easily implementable properly.
    ///
    /// Instead, delegation is used and most calls to a Godot object query the script instance
    /// first. This way, some methods can be "overwritten" and new ones can be exposed.
    ///
    /// This only works when using so called "variant calls", since the querying of the script
    /// instance is performed there.
    /// When not using variant calls, any direct(*) calls have to be made to the Godot object
    /// directly.
    ///
    /// The base type describes the "most general" type of object this script class can be
    /// attached to.
    ///
