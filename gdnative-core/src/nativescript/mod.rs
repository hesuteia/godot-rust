//! Functionality for user-defined types exported to the engine (native scripts)
//!
//! NativeScript allows users to have their own scripts in a native language (in this case Rust).
//! It is _not_ the same as GDNative, the native interface to call into Godot.
//!
//! Symbols in this module allow registration, exporting and management of user-defined types
//! which are wrapped in native scripts.
//!
//! If you are looking for how to manage Godot core types or classes (objects), check
//! out the [`core_types`][crate::core_types] and [`object`][crate::object] modules, respectively.
